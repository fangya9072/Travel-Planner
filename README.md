# Travel-Planner
This is a web project. The complete project uses a flight API that enables the user to search and book tickets. However, this functionality requires a school vpn so I changed the code to aviod that part. The version now contains codes related to flight-searching but they won't be used. It does use Google Map API and Open Weather API.
